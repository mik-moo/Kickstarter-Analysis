### Recommendations
- US Campaigns launched in May were the most successful. January, June, July and October were successful, but had about the same amount of campaigns that failed.  
- The theatre category in the US had more successes than failures, as did the play category. 
- Lower fundraising goals in Great Britain had greater success.  Consider reducing the budget by about half for a greater chance at a successful campaign for a musical in this market.  
- Theatre categories are the most successful in Great Britain.
